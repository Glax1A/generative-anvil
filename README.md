# generative-anvil
This python will take a wordlist and output it with many more options. Just try and see!
Note that I am not very good at python, so bear with me, and also, I would love to know why on earth certain features only half work?????????

uianvil.py is for running in CMD and entering your preferences from the command line, best for most of you!

anvil.py needs to be edited inside the python code so that it does what you need when run.

Please do not hesitate to lend a hand and fix anything!!!
